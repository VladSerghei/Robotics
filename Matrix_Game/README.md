Battleships  
  
The game is a replica of the well-known classic game battleships, played by two players, where each player  
places some ships of a different size (3/4/5-long) on a map and then they take turns trying to find the other's  
player ships. The ships have to be at least one square away in any direction from each other.  
  
The game is implemented on a 8x8 LED matrix, with an LCD screen used as menu and also to help the steps in game.  
Initially, there will be a menu on the LCD where the players can choose to play, change settings, or see highscores.  
In game, there will be a planning phase where the players place their ships in order (player 1 and then player 2).  
After that, the game begins and the players take turns trying to find the other's player ships.  
Difficulty can be chosen from options, higher difficulty meaning that there will be a timer on the player's turns and   
also the players will have less ships. The score is calculated using a formula that contains the time until winning,  
the level of difficulty and the number of ships left on the player's own board when winning. The highscores  
will be also saved on the EEPROM to be kept even if the board is closed.
