An arduino program that controls an LCD display illustrating a simple game menu    
It has 4 screens:  
1)Main menu  
Here you can choose whether to play,change settings or view highscores.  
2)Play  
This window simulates a game with lives and levels that ends after 10 seconds.  
3)Settings  
Here you can change the player name, which is read from the serial monitor, or change the starting level(0-9),  
which affects the score(score = level * 3).  
4)Highscore
The highest score achieved until the current time is shown here. The value is stored in EEPROM so it is not lost  
when the board is closed
